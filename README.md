# Game Name: MULTIPLE GAME

Description:

In this project, we work on various kinds of games, specifically focusing on children to enrich their knowledge and thinking capability. 
1.Tic-Tac-Toe:
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. If you are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

2.Snake Game:
The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.

3.Snake and Ladder – Ludo Game: 
Snakes and ladders are a simple and exciting game, Snake and ladders game is based on luck. In this game, you will have to roll down the dice, to move to different positions on the board, wherein on the journey to the destination, you will be pulled down by snakes and raised to a higher position by a ladder.

Game Play:

There have different types of theose games like Easy version, Medium Version, Hard Version, man vs man and man vs computer.


Player Goal:


1.Tic-Tac-Toe:
The goal of Tic Tac Toe is for a player to successfully align a set of their own symbols (traditionally "X" or "O") horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a 3x3 grid. The game is typically played by two players taking turns to place their symbol in an empty cell of the grid. The player who achieves the first alignment of three of their symbols in a row wins the game.

2.Snake Game:
The goal of the Snake game is to control a snake on a game board, guiding it to consume food items that appear randomly. As the snake eats the food, it grows longer. The objective is to grow the snake as much as possible without colliding with the game board's boundaries or the snake's own tail.

3.Snake and Ladder – Ludo Game:
Players roll a die and navigate the board. Landing on a ladder advances a player to a square further up the board, while landing on a snake means they must go back to a previous square.The aim of the game is to reach the final square. The game is a race that’s based on sheer luck and is popular with children.


Development Goal:

1.Tic-Tac-Toe:
Tic Tac Toe is well known game that is simple to grasp, easy to adapt and excellent for building beginner planning, problem solving and perspective taking skills. This post is going to focus on how you can use Tic Tac Toe to help develop your child's gross motor, fine motor, social, emotional and cognitive skills.

2.Snake Game:
Most board games are useful for helping children develop confidence with important mathematical skills and understanding. Snakes and Ladders is a great game to help a child to develop confidence in quantifying collections – and it's fun for all the family.

3.Snake and Ladder-Ludo Game:
While developing the ludo and snake ladder game, we wanted to ensure it can engage multiple players. We wanted to have a group of five or six people playing the game together. With AI-based algorithms, we ensured that the game against the computer is equally interesting and interactive.
